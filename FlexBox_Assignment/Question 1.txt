The main differences between Flexbox and Grid layout models come down to dimensionality and focus:

Dimensionality:
    Flexbox: One-dimensional. Great for arranging items in a single row or column, with control over alignment and spacing. It excels at layouts that adapt to different screen sizes by changing the number of items on a row.
    Grid: Two-dimensional. Perfect for creating complex layouts with rows and columns simultaneously. It provides more granular control over the placement of elements.

Focus:
    Flexbox: Alignment and one-dimensional distribution. Ideal for simple layouts like navigation bars, centering content, or aligning items in a form.
    Grid: Overall structure and two-dimensional placement. Shines in creating complex layouts like dashboards, product galleries, or intricate web applications.


When to use which:

Use Flexbox for:
    Simple, one-dimensional layouts with a focus on alignment and distribution.
    Responsive layouts where the number of items in a row needs to adjust to screen size.
    Aligning elements within a container.
Use Grid Layout for:
    Complex layouts requiring precise control over rows and columns.
    Layouts with nested structures.
    Layouts with areas of varying sizes.
