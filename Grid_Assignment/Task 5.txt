Both justify-items and justify-self are CSS properties used in CSS Grid Layout for aligning grid items along the horizontal axis (main axis). However, they apply to different levels within the grid structure:

**justify-items
    justify-items is a property that aligns all grid items within their respective grid cells along the inline axis (horizontal axis in a left-to-right layout).

    ``css``
        .grid-container {
        display: grid;
        grid-template-columns: 100px 100px;
        justify-items: center; /* Aligns all grid items in the center horizontally */
        }

        .item {
        background-color: lightblue;
        padding: 10px;
        border: 1px solid blue;
        }

    In this example:

    grid-template-columns: 100px 100px; sets up a grid with two columns, each 100px wide.
    justify-items: center; centers all grid items within their respective cells horizontally. This means each item will be centered within its column.

**justify-self
    justify-self is a property that aligns an individual grid item within its grid cell along the inline axis.

    ``css``

        .grid-container {
        display: grid;
        grid-template-columns: 100px 100px;
        }

        .item {
        background-color: lightblue;
        padding: 10px;
        border: 1px solid blue;
        justify-self: end; /* Aligns this particular item to the end of its cell horizontally */
        }

    In this example:

    grid-template-columns: 100px 100px; sets up a grid with two columns, each 100px wide.
    .item is a grid item styled with justify-self: end;, which aligns it to the end of its grid cell horizontally. This means this particular item will be aligned to the right edge of its column.

*Key Differences
    Scope: justify-items applies to all grid items within the grid container, aligning them within their respective grid cells.
 
    Target: justify-self applies to individual grid items, allowing you to align each item differently within its own grid cell.
